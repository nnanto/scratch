# AUI - Adaptive User Interfaces

A collection of interactive demos exploring adaptive user interfaces and emergent behaviors in digital systems.

## 📋 Current Projects

### 🔴 Emergent Synchronization
An interactive p5.js simulation demonstrating emergent synchronization behavior in distributed systems. Watch as individual pulsing balls naturally self-organize into synchronized groups through local energy interactions—no central coordination required.
